Most things will slowly replenish like clay deposits, boulders

some items ( stuff just laying on the ground ([[sticks]], [[leaves]])) will actually despawn over time but will respawn around other objects ([[tree]]s, [[bush]]es)

some stuff might not respawn (there should be ways to get it infinitely)

Plants will propagate themselves as the seed of trees will drop around the [[tree]] "planting" another [[tree]].
